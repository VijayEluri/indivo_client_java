<body>
<p>This is the README file for the binary distribution of indivo_client_java-1.x, which is distributed as its indivo_client_java-1.x.tar file.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>cp indivo_client_java-1.x.tar &lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>cd &lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>tar -xf indivo_client_java-1.x.tar</code><br/></li>
<li>Add </code>&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/indivo_client_java-1.x/indivo_client_java-1.x.jar</code>
to the classpath of your client application.</li>
<li>Add the .jar files in </code>&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/indivo_client_java-1.x/lib</code>
to the classpath of your client application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
indivo_client_java-1.x.jar contains the classes a Java Indivo client application might use directly.
Writing http code to access the Indivo REST interface directly is an alternative.  We think using
the classes in indivo_client_java-1.x.jar will be easier.
</p>

<p>
point your browser to <code>file:///&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/javadoc/index.html</code>.
The gateway to this API is the class <code>org.indivo.client.Rest</code> or, identical except for method names,
<code>org.indivo.client.Rest_py_client_style</code>.
Methods that stand in for Indivo API REST calls are, in <code>Rest</code>, named with the REST URL modified for Java
 compatability.
In <code>Rest_py_client_style</code> the same methods are named as in the Indivo Python client.
</p>
<p>
indivo_client_java depends on some 3rd party .jar files, all included in this distribution, in the lib directory.
see NOTICES.txt for 3rd party jar license info.
</p>
<p>
For the source distribution from which this binary distribution is built:<br/>
<code>git clone git://github.com/chb/indivo_client_java.git</code><br/>
