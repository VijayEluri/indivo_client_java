<body>
<p>This is the README file for the binary distribution of indivo_client_java-1.x in its .tar file.</p>

<p>
indivo_client_java-1.x.jar contains the classes a Java Indivo client application might use.
Writing http code to access the Indivo REST interface directly is an alternative.  We think using
the classes in indivo_client_java-1.x.jar is more convenient.
</p>

<p>
point your browser to <code>file:///&lt;indivo_client_java-installation_directory&gt;/javadoc/index.html</code>.
The gateway to this API is the class <code>org.indivo.client.Rest</code> or, identical except for method names,
<code>org.indivo.client.Rest_py_client_style</code>.
Methods that stand in for Indivo API REST calls are. in <code>Rest</code>, named with the REST URL modified for Java
 compatability.
In <code>Rest_py_client_style</code> the same methods are named as in the Indivo Python client.
</p>
<p>
indivo_client_java depends on some 3rd party .jar files, all included in this distribution, in the lib directory.
see NOTICES.txt for 3rd party jar license info.
</p>
<p>
For the source distribution from which this binary distribution is built:<br/>
