<html><head><title>README for indivo_client_java binary distribution</title></head>

<body>
<p>This is the README file for the <strong>binary distribution of indivo_client_java-1.x</strong>,
 which is distributed as its indivo_client_java-1.x.tar file.<br/>
Writing http code to access the Indivo REST interface directly is an alternative.  We think using
the classes in indivo_client_java-1.x.jar will be easier.
</p>

<p>
For most purposes, it is recommended to use this binary distribution.  If you have a need for the source from
from which this binary distribution is built:<br/>
<code>git clone git://github.com/chb/indivo_client_java.git</code><br/>
[you must have git installed]
</p>


<p>
<strong>Install</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>cp indivo_client_java-1.x.tar &lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>cd &lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>tar -xf indivo_client_java-1.x.tar</code><br/></li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Classpath</strong><br/>
indivo_client_java-1.x.jar contains the classes a Java Indivo client application might use directly.<br/>
Add <code>&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/indivo_client_java-1.x/indivo_client_java-1.x.jar</code>
to the classpath of your client application.<br/><br/>
indivo_client_java depends on some 3rd party .jar files, all included in this distribution, in the lib directory.
see NOTICES.txt for 3rd party jar license info.<br/>
Add the .jar files in <code>&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/indivo_client_java-1.x/lib</code>
to the classpath of your client application.
</p>

<p>
<strong>API documentation</strong><br/>
point your browser to <code>file:///&lt;binary-installation-directory&gt;/indivo_client_java-1.x/javadoc/index.html</code>.<br/><br/>
The gateway to this API is the class <code>org.indivo.client.Rest</code> or, identical except for method names,
<code>org.indivo.client.Rest_py_client_style</code>.<br/><br/>
Methods that stand in for Indivo API REST calls are, in <code>Rest</code>, named with the REST URL modified for Java
 compatability.
In <code>Rest_py_client_style</code> the same methods are named as in the Indivo Python client.

<strong>Examples</strong><br/>
