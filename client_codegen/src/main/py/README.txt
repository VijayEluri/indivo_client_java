Some of the modules here are used from shell scripts in installation_directory>/client_codegen/bin

Other modules are used to create detailed_api.xml  An already created detailed_api.xml is provided in the binay distribution,
so there is no need to run the detailed_api.xml creation process.  The code is kept for archival purposes.
"python gen_skel_aux.py" was used to create the intermediate file: api_skel_auxiliary.py
"python add_to_apixml.py" was used to create: detailed_api.xml
