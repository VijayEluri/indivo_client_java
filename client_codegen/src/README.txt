This is the README file for the binary distribution of indivo_client_java-1.x in its .tar file.

tar -xf indivo_client_java-1.x

indivo_client_java-1.x.jar contains the classes an Indivo client application written in Java might use.
Writing http code to access the Indivo REST interface directly is an alternative.  We think using
the classes in indivo_client_java-1.x.jar is more convenient.

point your browser to file:///..../javadoc/index.xml in the javadoc directory

the class org.indivo.client.Rest has the public methods a client application will typically use.

indivo_client_java depends on some 3rd party .jar files, all included in this distribution, in the lib directory.
